This is the Perl distribution PerlIO-via-ToFirePHP.

## Description

This PerlIO layer sends everything it receives to FirePHP. When constructing a
filehandle using this layer using "open()", you need to pass an object of type
FirePHP::Dispatcher that has been initialized with a HTTP::Headers object.

A typical use of this PerlIO layer is to send DBI trace output to FirePHP:

    use PerlIO::via::ToFirePHP;

    my $dbh = DBI->connect(...);

    open my $fh, '>:via(ToFirePHP)',
        FirePHP::Dispatcher->new($http_headers_object);
    $dbh->trace(2, $fh);

Now the trace output of all calls to that database handle will be sent to
FirePHP.

## Installation

PerlIO-via-ToFirePHP installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

    % cpan PerlIO::via::ToFirePHP

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:
